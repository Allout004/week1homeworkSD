# Week 1: Refactoring Code

This weeks homework was about refactoring code that was given to make it easier to read and follow when looking through it.

Somethings I did where removing multiple classes in the css file, that where only called once and changed some names of the class to better follow the naming conventions of the document. Also added a couple of notes to help show the changes that I did in the file as well as easier to find headings and other tags to allow for faster searching.
